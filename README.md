## 📊 Feature Selection, Data Preprocessing & Model Improvement

A rigorous machine learning pipeline was implemented to ensure high accuracy and generalizability of the model.

---

### 🧪 Statistical Testing & Feature Selection

- ✅ **Chi-Square Test:** Assessed the dependency between categorical features (e.g., `MARITALSTATUS`, `EDUCATION`) and the target variable `Approved_Flag`. Features with **p-value < 0.05** were selected.
- ✅ **ANOVA F-Test:** Applied to numerical features to determine their statistical significance with respect to the target.
- ✅ **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Removed features with **high multicollinearity (VIF > 6)** to avoid redundant information.
- ✅ **Hypothesis Testing:** Applied across feature types to support statistically sound feature engineering.

---

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

- 🧼 **Handled Missing Values** using appropriate imputation techniques.
- 🔗 **Merged Two Datasets** to enhance the available features and improve prediction capability.
- 🧠 **Feature Encoding:** Used Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding where necessary to convert categorical variables.
- 📐 **Data Alignment:** Ensured input format strictly matches the training data structure expected by the model.

---

### 🔧 Model Training & Optimization

- ⚙️ **Model Used:** `XGBoostClassifier`
- 🔍 **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Performed exhaustive **Grid Search** to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.
- 🔁 **Cross-Validation:** Integrated cross-validation during grid search to avoid overfitting.
- 📈 **Accuracy Boost:** Achieved a significant performance improvement, increasing model accuracy by **~78%** through tuning and preprocessing.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **🧾 User Input:** Multi-step form collects user data
2. **📤 API Request:** Data sent to `/predict` Flask endpoint as JSON
3. **🧪 Preprocessing:** Data is encoded/mapped to model format
4. **🤖 Prediction:** Model returns a class (0–3)
5. **🔁 Response Mapping:** Output mapped to risk labels (`P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4`)
6. **📺 Result Display:** Prediction shown dynamically on frontend
